## Hello, I'm Zeinn

I love Cloud Computing and Cybersecurity. 

Outside of tech, I train in calisthenics and currently working towards the almighty **Planche** and building longer holds on **Front Lever**. I'm fond of difficult games like Sekiro or outstanding story games such as The Last of Us, RDR2, and Ghost of Tsushima. I also love coffee...
