## Hello, I'm Zeinn

I love Cloud Computing and Cybersecurity. 

Outside of tech, I grind through games like **Dark Souls** (and keep coming back for more suffering). I like games that punish you until you ***git gud***. I also train in calisthenics and currently working towards the almighty **Planche** and building longer holds on **Front Lever**. I also love coffee...

### Projects: The Armory
- 🛡️ **[Aegis AWS Security Automation](https://github.com/z31nnx/aegis-aws-security)**  
  The shield. A fortress of security guardrails: KMS, CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty, automated remediation. Defense by design.  

- 🔱 **[Trident 3-Tier AWS Architecture](https://github.com/z31nnx/trident-aws-3tier)**  
  The trident of architecture, 3 prongs. A high-availability 3-tier design built twice: manual and Terraform. Proof of mastery in both craftsmanship and automation.  

- 🎯 **Gungnir – CI/CD Delivery on ECS (Coming Soon)**  
  Odin’s spear, which never misses its mark. This project is my precision strike: secure CI/CD pipelines, container hardening, blue/green deployments, and policy-gated delivery.
